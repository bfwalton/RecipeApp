# FAQ

## Commonly Asked Questions

### Why is Saucier free?

Saucier is a hobby project done in my spare time and does not make any money from users. Someday Saucier may include ads or offer a subscription but as long as you have Saucier we won't remove your ability to access recipes you've already added to the app.

### I have feedback or an idea for the app that I would like to share

This isn't a question but thank you for your feedback! Please send us an email at <a href="mailto:help@saucier-app.com">help@saucier-app.com</a>!

### Do you have plans to include CloudKit sharing in your app?
